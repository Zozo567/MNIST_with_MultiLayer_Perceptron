# MNIST with Multi Layer Perceptron

We will be using the famous [MNIST data set][mndata].

### Data Format
The data is stored in a vector format, although the original data was a 2-dimensional matirx with values representing how much pigment was at a certain location.


### Parameters

We'll need to define 4 parameters, it is really (really) hard to know what good parameter values are on a data set for which you have no experience with, however since MNIST is pretty famous, we have some reasonable values for our data below. The parameters here are:
- Learning Rate - How quickly to adjust the cost function.
- Training Epochs - How many training cycles to go through
- Batch Size - Size of the 'batches' of training data
